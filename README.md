# This Project does not guarantee that test all the javascript features properly on your browser.
Caution!

It contains codes of eval and running code.
Because when evaluating the browser's javascript functionalities, 
It executes a set of test functions on run-time, unlikely other benchmark sites.

Primarily, the Object.assign function will be evaluated not properly. 
Because to work with React, I injected Object.assign manually.
Therefore test status is the pass, always.
